12.15mm pulley diameter
Napkin math:
Assume 200 steps / rotation stepper motor

Problem is doing of speeds differing amounts of movements on both axis?
Need to do some calculation on the time required for the steps

243pi/20 the circumference of the pulley,
with 200 steps per rotation,
movement is approx 0.19085mm 

Doesnt really need microstepping?

Might need to create a python script to just strip the thing of the G01 and replace with G0, G01 moves require a feed rate which causes the UGS to freak out

X Y and Z are simply the cartesian coordinates of the poins
Don't really understand the 

Easy way:
Main concern is that the table is not pure cartesian'ish system
Apparently the corexy can be fixed via config.h in GRBl

Hard way:
Write code from scratch to coordinate the 2 stepper motors
